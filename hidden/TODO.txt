Generally:
	1. Address "TODO"s when solution is availible
	2. Clean up code, utilize new functionalities
In order:
	-1. EHANDLES!!!
		1. Store entity index
		2. Store unique entity ID
		3. Return pointer if entity at entity index has same unique entity ID
			- THINK OF CASES WHICH COULD BREAK THIS SYSTEM, PLAN AHEAD!
	0. Implement initialization better first before anything else
	1. Implement entity assets by any means nessecary, don't mind if it's not cleaned up at all, it's all just temporary.
		a. Prioritize customization of assets, especially the use of reflective surfaces
	2. CLEAN THE FUCK OUT OF THE CODE:
		a. const
		b. virtual functions
		c. class initialization (move away from getters/setters and move towards whatever hl2 does)
		d. eliminate ANY AND ALL MEMORY LEAKS -- obvious
		e. restructure any improper class structures
		f. In general, prepare for next in list
	3. Implement console command to create entities by name with optional named arguments
	4. Work on adapting above to map loading feature
	5. Work on adapting above to save/loading feature
	6. Work on understanding and giving further control over the animation system (for ragdolls later)
	7. Implement physics engine
